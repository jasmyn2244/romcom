INTRODUCTION
------------
This is a repo of the romcom project for Turing School of Design and Software. We forked from a boilerplate repository and add the following features.
- On page loads, we should see a random generated cover with a randomly selected image, title, and tagline which includes two random descriptors.
- User can select the button, "Show New Random Cover Button", and have a new cover randomly generated.
- When user clicks the button, "Make Your Own Cover Button", user is able to input values for their own cover and display their made cover.
- On the button, "Save Cover", user is able to save the current cover on screen.
- User can view saved covers when the button, "View Saved Covers" is selected.

- User can select the button, "Show New Random Cover Button", and have a new cover randomly generated.
- When user clicks the button, "Make Your Own Cover Button", user is able to input values for their own cover and display their made cover.
- On the button, "Save Cover", user is able to save the current cover on screen.
